# OpenSpaceDistancing

> Manage your open space with social distancing in mind

This is just a little experiment to manage open spaces by using a grid.
This is just the generated grid not the part that draws the grid...which I haven't done.

Install it, launch it and see what it does.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
